# Agora BETA

## Getting Started
```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/Agora.git

# change directory to our repo
cd Agora

# WINDOWS only. In terminal as administrator
npm install -g node-pre-gyp
```

## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ (or `v7.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file)

## Installing
Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack`
* `webpack-dev-server`
* `karma`
* `protractor`
* `rimraf`
* `typescript`
* `cross-env`
```
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install -g protractor
npm install -g rimraf
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g cross-env
npm install -g artillery
```
## Running the app

* Local development environment

For local development you'll need the MongoDB Local (Downloadable Version). For a guid on how to install MongoDB, go to [this link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). On Windows, you can get it from the following Download Center link [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?_ga=2.62089900.1820272119.1524602800-952612734.1523898940&_gac=1.79428326.1523898940.CjwKCAjwk9HWBRApEiwA6mKWacqRgoYOQ4ayn_M_ol5d5C7yy0aTEbZjKsersvLRfXJAozzJyqu29RoClFoQAvD_BwE#production).

After you downloaded it, go to the root of your `C` drive and create a `data` folder. After that, `cd` into the `data` folder and make a new folder called `db`.
Mongo knows to go to this folder automatically to retrieve and store data. To run MongoDB, you need to start the process at the installation location, e.g. go to:

```bash
# If you added mongo to your path, you can issue this from anywhere
C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER>cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin"

C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\3.6\\bin>mongod
```

You should see a connection to port `27017` (MongoDB default port). You can also specify an alternate path and port for this. The connection itself will come from
our Express server through Mongoose (a framework that allows us to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document).

```bash
[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
```

If you also installed `MongoDB Compass` along with the main installation (a GUI to manage your `MongoDB` databases), just open it and connect to your localhost (use the default values). You'll notice a few connections opened in the cmd prompt with the database running (the one open with `MongoDB` listening on port `27017`). You should see something like:

```bash
[listener] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:57948 #2 (2 connections now open)
```

Go back to `MongoDB Compass` and create a database called `agora`. In the Create Database form, use `genes` for the collection name. Now that we are all set, it's time to load the data into our collections.

# Downloading the data

The following commands will download four data files (`rnaseq_differential_expression.json`, `network.json`, `gene_info.json`, `team_info.json`) and all of the team images. You can download all of them using the `synapseclient`. Install the package manager `pip` [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). After that, install the `synapseclient` using the following command:

```bash
pip install synapseclient
```

To get the data files using credentials provided by AWS, run:

```bash
npm run data:local-aws
```

If you have your own Synapse credentials, you can run:

```bash
npm run data:local
```

If you are on an AWS EC2 that has been granted access (e.g., for deployment) you can run:

```bash
npm run data:aws
```

If the `aws` command fails in any of the scripts, you might be running the wrong version. To use `aws secretsmanager` you need the `aws cli` version to be `1.15.8` and upwards

```bash
aws --version
# Exemple of incorrect version
aws-cli/1.14.65 Python/2.7.9 Windows/8 botocore/1.9.18
```

To manually update your version go to [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-install-macos.html) link.

You should see all of the data files and teams members pictures in the folders created by any of the scripts above.

To add those images to our database, we are going to use the `mongofiles` executable. If you did not add mongo to your `PATH`, copy the images to the `Mongo` binary directory or run the executable remotely from the images directory (replace `mongofiles` in the next command for the binary path). If you have `Mongo` in your `PATH` use the following script command:

```bash
# Imports all data files and team images
npm run mongo:import
```

You'll need `Linux` to run the previous script. If you need to do this in `Windows`, you can get any `Linux` distribution at the `Windows Store` (e.g. `Ubuntu`).

* Remote production environment

There are two ways to use this application in a remote production environment. One is by copying the dist or root project folder to a remote machine and the second one is by copying the Docker image and running it. The first method will be discussed in this section, and the other one will be discussed in the deployment section.

If you are copying the dist folder, install Node in the remote machine. Then, install MongoDB and populate the needed collections (follow the steps described above). Start the application by running `node` against the `server.js` file.

If you are copying the entire project, install Node and any needed global dependencies in the remote machine. Then, run `npm install` to get all local dependencies installed and just follow the same steps for the local development (see below). You'll need to expose port `3000` so anyone can access the application.

In both cases the final URL will be the remote machine public ip.

* Final step

After you have installed all dependencies and got every requirement ready you can run the app. Open the project in an IDE or navigate to the root project folder and, in a terminal opened in that folder, you can run:

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

This builds the client-side of the application. If you need to watch for changes use `watch` instead of `build`. The client configuration can run webpack with the `--watch` flag, so any change made to the `src/` folder (except the `src/server` folder) will rebuild the application. At the moment, you need to reload the application manually after changing the files on the client-side. If you want to reload it automatically, use the `webpack-dev-server` by running the command `npm run server:dev` **only**, no need to run the next command.

If you just built the application you are set for the next command. If you used the `watch` flag, leave that terminal open and open another one. In the second one you can issue our second command to get the server up and running.

```bash
npm start
```

The server configuration uses the `nodemon-webpack-plugin` when building, so if you run the server with `npm run server` or `npm start`, it will reload if you change files in the `src/server` folder.

You don't need to stop the server when changing client-side files. This is because they use different packaging pipes. You just need to restart the server when changing a route name or a configuration file, for instance. In this case, just stop the server and do another `npm start`.

The Express server will route the app for us and will communicate to MongoDB through Mongoose, the requests will be sent back to the Angular front-end. **Since we are loading a huge database locally, it is recommended that you have a good amount of RAM so that MongoDB won't crash**.

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod
# production AoT
npm run build:aot
```

### server
```bash

```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# AoT Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Donâ€™t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Donâ€™t use default exports.
- Donâ€™t use `form.controls.controlName`, use `form.get(â€˜controlNameâ€™)`
- Donâ€™t use `control.errors?.someError`, use `control.hasError(â€˜someErrorâ€™)`
- Donâ€™t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- @Inputs, @Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# External Stylesheets
Any stylesheets (Sass or CSS) placed in the `src/styles` directory and imported into your project will automatically be compiled into an external `.css` and embedded in your production builds.

For example to use Bootstrap as an external stylesheet:
1) Create a `styles.scss` file (name doesn't matter) in the `src/styles` directory.
2) `npm install` the version of Boostrap you want.
3) In `styles.scss` add `@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';`
4) In `src/app/core/core.module.ts` add underneath the other import statements: `import '../styles/styles.scss';`

Since we are using PrimeNG, style rules might not be applied to nested Angular children components. There are two ways to solve this issue enforce style scoping:

* Special Selectors

You can keep the Shadow DOM (emulated browser encapsulation) and still apply rules from third party libraries to nested children with this approach. This is the recommended way, but it is harder to implement in certain scenarios.

```bash
:host /deep/ .ui-paginator-bottom {
    display: none;
}
```

* Disable View Encapsulation

This is the easiest way to apply nested style rules, just go to the component and turn off the encapsulation. This way the rules are passed from parent to children without problems, but any rule created in one component affects the other components. This project uses this approach, so be aware to create style classes with using names related to the current component only.

```bash
...
import { ..., ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component {
...
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
}
```

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 2.1.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

### Visual Studio Code + Debugger for Chrome
> Install [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and see docs for instructions to launch Chrome

The included `.vscode` automatically connects to the webpack development server on port `3000`.

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal:
```shell
npm i @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
```
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check:
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
npm install @types/node
npm install @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```

# Deployment

## Docker

Before using Docker go one level above the root folder of the project and create a folder called `data`:

```bash
PATH_TO_PROJECT\Agora> cd ..
PATH_TO_PROJECT> mkdir data
PATH_TO_PROJECT> mkdir data/team_images
```

This folder will be used to load the data into MongoDB when we build the DOcker image. Go ahead and grab the latest data files from the [Downloading the data](#downloading-the-data) section. Copy all the `.json` files described in the download section to the `data` folder you just created.

The easiest way to deploy this project is by using Docker. Just follow [this](https://docs.docker.com/ee/) link and choose your OS on the left side menu. After installing docker you need to start it and test if your installation went correct:

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40
```

The project is configured in a way that we can connect to MongoDB inside the Docker container or outside it. If you are in a container, the MongoDB URL uses the `mongodb` name (if you want to change it, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root level and the `server.ts` file accordingly). The final URL will be localhost for development and production if done in your local machine. If you deploy this application to an EC2 machine, the URL can be the public ip address of that machine or a domain name (this project uses the name `agora.ampadportal.org` in the `Nginx` configuration).

Start `Docker`, go to the project root and run `npm run build:docker`. This command will build an image called `agora` with everything you need. If this is the second time around, and you just want to launch the application again (without rebuilding), run `npm run docker:up`. If you need to use parts of the cache when building and skip rebuilding everything, you can use `npm run docker:app -- build` or `npm run docker:mongo -- build`.

```bash
# Building for the first time or rebuilding
npm run build:docker
# Using cached versions
npm run docker:up
# Building and running
npm run docker
```

Now go to `localhost` and you should see the application up. If you run into the following errors:

```bash
...Cannot start service mongodb: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint...
Error starting userland proxy: mkdir /port/tcp:0.0.0.0:27017:tcp:172.19.0.2:27017: input/output error
```

```bash
mongodb: forward host lookup failed: Unknown host
# or
server can't find mongodb: NXDOMAIN
```

Try to restart or even reopen Docker and see if the error goes away. If Docker started without enough RAM it might error out.

```bash
ERROR: The Compose file '././docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
networks.front_agora value Additional properties are not allowed ('name' was unexpected)
# or
Exception: Unknown docker network 'agora_network'. Did you create it with 'docker network create agora_network'
```

You may be running out of space, run `docker system prune` press `y`. If that doesn't solve you can run `docker network create agora_network` if the network does not exist.

To remove all images and containers (to restart the whole Docker process) you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
# Delete all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
# Delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

To remove all unused containers:

```bash
# Remove all containers with the Exited status
docker rm $(docker ps -q -f status=exited)
```

To remove all unused volumes (good to prevent out of space problems):
```bash
# Removed all dangling volumes
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
```

To remove all images and containers:

```bash
# Remove eveything
docker system prune
```

## Style Guide and Project Structure

This project follows the directions provided by the official [angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). Things that the guide state to keep in mind:

* Define components or services that do one thing only, per file. Try to use small sized functions where possible, making it reusable.

* Keep the consistency in file and folder names. Use dashes to separate words in the descriptive prefix name and dots to separate the suffix words. Use the type and extension names in the file name, e.g. `a.component.ts`, `a.service.ts` or `a.module.ts`. The style guide has references about naming the other types of files in an Angular project.

* The guide advises to use a `main.ts` file for boostrapping, we are using the notation `main.browser.ts` since it was modified for different configurations. It is also a reminder that is where the `platform browser` is.

* Use camel case for variable names, even for constants as they are easy to read. If the values don't change, use a const declaration. For Interfaces use an upper camel case, e.g. `MyInterface`.

* The guide advises separating application from third party imports. This projects goes one step further separating imports by source and purpose also, grouping Angular framework, project components and services, third party typescript/javascript libraries separately.

* The folder structure in not restrictive in the style guide, but it should be structured in a way so it is to maintain and expand the project, and identify files in a glance. This project uses a root folder called `src` and one main folder for each module. When a spacific folder reaches seven or more files it is split into sub-folders. Another reason to split is to keep a view smart component with container dumb components as children.

* For the file structure this project uses the component approach. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:

```

# Database

MongoDB was chosen for this project because it is an object-oriented, simple, dynamic, and scalable NoSQL database. It is based on the NoSQL document store model. The data objects are stored as separate documents inside a collection. Pros:

* Document oriented

* High performance

* High availability â€” Replication

* High scalability â€“ Sharding

* Dynamic â€” No rigid schema.

* Flexible â€“ field addition/deletion have less or no impact on the application

* Heterogeneous Data

* No Joins

* Distributed

* Data Representation in JSON or BSON

* Geospatial support

* Easy Integration with BigData Hadoop

* Document-based query language thatâ€™s nearly as powerful as SQL

* Cloud distributions such as AWS, Microsoft, RedHat,dotCloud and SoftLayer etc:-. In fact, MongoDB is built for the cloud. Its native scale-out architecture, enabled by â€˜sharding,â€™ aligns well with the horizontal scaling and agility afforded by cloud computing.
