            The results shown on this page are derived from proteomics analysis
            of post-mortem brains from AD cases and controls. The samples were
            obtained from up to four human cohort studies across a total of four
            different brain regions.

            expressed between AD cases and controls. The box plots depict how
            the differential expression of the selected protein of interest (red
            dot) compares with expression of other proteins in a given brain
            region. Summary statistics for each tissue can be viewed by hovering
